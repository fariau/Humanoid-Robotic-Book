## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks.md file with 8 phases containing 130 specific, actionable tasks for implementing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Platform. The tasks follow the 5-phase implementation approach from the plan and map to all 5 user stories from the specification. Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The tasks cover infrastructure, authentication, personalization, multilingual support, RAG chatbot, 13 chapters with all required components, and deployment. The tasks are organized to enable independent testing of each user story and include parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for implementing the textbook platform
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation using /sp.implement or manual execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks comprehensively cover all requirements with proper organization and dependencies
